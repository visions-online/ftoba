## Why This Site Exists

This repository was created to provide public access to court documents that some parties have attempted to keep hidden. We believe that transparency in the legal process is essential for justice. Here, you'll find documents related to lawsuits against the Oklahoma Bar Association, Oklahoma Supreme Court, and other implicated entities.

## What You'll Find

- **Federal Lawsuit Documents:** Access the complete collection of federal court filings, including the 300+ page complaint and related documents.
- **Supporting Evidence:** Review over 1,000 pages of exhibits submitted to federal court that detail the allegations and evidence.
- **Emergency Motions:** Access emergency injunctive relief applications and related pleadings that highlight urgent matters.
- **Legal Templates:** Use our curated collection of templates to assist in your own legal filings.
- **Educational Resources:** Access guides and documentation to help you understand and navigate the legal documents.

## Our Goals

- **Promote Transparency:** Make previously hidden court documents accessible to the public.
- **Enable Accountability:** Provide evidence and documentation that supports accountability in the legal system.
- **Empower Action:** Give individuals the tools and information needed to take informed legal action.
